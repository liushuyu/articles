Hello, world! I didn't put my thoughts and other stuff on the Internet until now.

Before that, I thought there was already an abundance of other people writing all kinds of technical articles and other exciting content. Therefore, I don't need to write anything since what I would have written was probably done better by someone else on this planet.

However, I eventually realized that sharing is caring. While there are tons of technical articles online, there will be some areas not covered by them. So I hope some of the contents here will help someone somewhere in this world somehow.
